Hi, I am Martin Kwok. I am a Physics Ph.D. student at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/physics/), 
expecting to graduate in August 2020.  
 
I am a member of the [Compact Muon Solenoid(CMS)](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) experiment at the 
[Large Hadron Collider(LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider), [CERN](https://home.cern/),
which is one of the largest scientific experiments ever-built.

My research focuses on [Higgs Physics](https://cms.cern/physics/cms-higgs-results)
 and searches for [exotic signatures](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/PhysicsResultsEXO)
 of new Physics in LHC data.
Many of my work center around boosted jets and using machine learning to understand jets better.

I worked with my thesis advisor Prof. [Greg Landsberg](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/glandsbe) on 
searching for highly boosted Higgs boson decaying into bottom quarks.
A non-technical introduction can be found in this [Physics briefing](https://cms.cern/news/boosting-unknown-highest-energy-higgs-bosons).

### Hobbies
 
Outside of Physics, I enjoy sports in general, in particular, badminton and bouldering.
You can checkout some of my training/competition videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGwNLWPxcvd0WQ90B1XxueA/).
