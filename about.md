Hi, I am Martin Kwok. I am a Ph.D. 
My research focuses on Higgs Physics and searches for exotic signatures of new Physics in LHC data.
Many of my work centers around boosted objects (i.e. particles that are produced with a lot of momentum in collision),

Here's my github page: [GitHub](https://github.com/kakwok)

### Hobbies
 
Outside of Physics, I enjoy sports in general, in particular, badminton and bouldering.
You can checkout some of my training/competition videos on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGwNLWPxcvd0WQ90B1XxueA/).
I often have some interesting thoughts on the physics of badminton and bouldering,
so I will occasionally shares my thoughts here as well.
